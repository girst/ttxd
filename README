TELETEXT SERVER
===============

Installation
------------

1. `./install.sh` as root
2. create `freqlist.conf` (see example in `src/`)
3. `scan -a $ADAPTERNO freqlist.conf > channels.conf`
4. use `ttxd.service` or `serv.sh` to start the service.

Usage
-----

1. run `serv.sh` to tune the TV card and start spooling pages
2. generate an HTML file by running `index.pl`

Caveats
-------

 * The spool directory and DVB adapter number are hardcoded in `dvbtext`; its source is in `./src/dvbtext-src/dvbtext.c`.
 * `index.pl`, `html.pl` and `plain.pl` do not support subpages other than 0.
 * `serv.sh` does not check if the card has been tuned; it simply waits 5 seconds.
 * The spool directory is `/run/ttxd/spool/`, to avoid disk wear.
 * The accompaning systemd service is `/etc/systemd/system/ttx.service`, where the names of the processes `dvbtext`, `tzap`, and `thttpd` are hardcoded. 
 * since `killall thttpd` is used to start and stop the service, rename that executable if you already running an instance of `thttpd` for other web services.

Notes
-----

Currently, the service is using `/dev/dvb/adapter0` (PCIe 05:00.0) for ORF via DVB-T.

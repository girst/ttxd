1. INSTALLATION
---------------

1) Modify the root spool directory (VTXDIR) at the start of dvbtext.c
   and the path to the DVB/ost/include directory from the driver source.

2) Compile the application by typing "make".

3) Create your spool directory and 8 subdirectories numbered "1" to "8"
   within that directory.  i.e.

        mkdir /video/vtx
        cd /video/vtx
        mkdir 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

   Obviously, these need to be writable by the user you run dvbtext as.

4) [Move the dvbtext executable into your path - e.g. /usr/local/bin]

NOTE: DVBtext uses the DVB driver's "new api".  You need to have the
correct devices created under /dev/ost/.  If you don't have these, run
the "makedev.napi" script in the DVB/driver directory.


2. USAGE
--------

1) Tune your DVB card to a channel - e.g. using VDR.  
2) Run dvbtext with a list of teletext PIDs for all the channels on the same
   transponder as your tuned channel.

e.g. Tune to ARD (11837h, sr: 27500, vpid: 101, apid:102) on Astra
19E.  Then type:

dvbtext 104 204 304 404 504 604 704 804

to spool the teletext pages for ARD, BR3, Hessen-3, ARTE, SR3, WDR,
BR-alpha and SWR BW simultaneously.

You can then view a page from your console using (for example) the
vtx2ascii program (contained in the oldstuff/vtx directory of the
xawtv source).

e.g. vtxc2ascii -c /video/vtx/1/100_00.vtx

Displays a colour (text-only) version on an ANSI capable terminal.

A channels.conf file for VDR (version 0.71pre2 or above) including
teletext PIDs for many channels on Astra 19 is included with DVBtext.
The teletext PID is the third field from the end - after the video and
audio PIDs.

NOTE: VDR and DVBtext can happily run together.  However, you will
need to stop and restart dvbtext with different parameters when you
change channels.
